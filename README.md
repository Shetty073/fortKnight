# FortKnight 
#### A discord.py bot for fortnite players on Discord
#### This is the new and complete rewrite of the original bot with alternate API source. This bot was originally intended for our discord server where me and my fortnite-loving friends have fun. I open-sourced it to share it others.

## Getting started
#### These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements
* Python 3.6 and above
* Python modules required
	* [discord.py rewrite](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite)

	* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

### Configuration
![`config.ini` file contents](https://i.imgur.com/gHSTUp9.png)
* The `config.ini` file is where you have to enter all your secret credentials 
* All the `ask` (help menu) command string is stored in ask.json - this makes it easy for me to update the `ask` command (help menu)
