### Requirements
* Python 3.6.5 or newer
* Important ones are discord.py and python-twitter (you can check requirements.txt)

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

### How to run?
* `git clone` or download this project as .zip
* Extract and open the file "fortKnight.py" in a code/text editor
* In the last line `bot.run("secret goes here")` replace the text `secret goes here` with your discord app token
  * Above step is important as the token is bots password and without it the bot will not log in and will be unusable
* Once done save and close the file
* Open commandline go to the folder where "fortKnight.py" is located then type and enter `python fortKnight.py`(python3 for Linux users) to run this bot
* Close the commandline to make the bot go offline
* For help on discord bot account and invitation refer [this](https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration/wiki/How-to-get-a-token-and-channel-ID-for-Discord)*
* Since this bot is revamped and work is being done from a fresh start you will need a free [twitter app account](https://apps.twitter.com/) so that you can get the four needed keys for the new tweet function to work

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Ignore the file named "Procfile" it is not required to run the bot from local machine.
