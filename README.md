# fortKnight-bot

### What is this?
*A discord bot for [Fortnite Battle Royale](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale) players* 

### How to use this?
*You can deploy this and run from your pc. See "requirements" and "How to run?" sections for more details*

### Why did you create this?
*So that there would be less fight between the players regarding where to go/land ðŸ˜‰. Just kidding, I created this because I like python and always wanted to write a bot*

### How does it work?

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

### Requirements
* Python 3.5.x or newer
* discord.py 0.16.6 or newer
* & other modules as listed in requirements.txt

### How to run?
* `git clone` or download this project as .zip
* Extract and open the file "fortKnight.py" in a code/text editor
* In the last line `bot.run("secret goes here")` replace the text `secret goes here` with your discord app token
  * Above step is important as the token is bots password and without it the bot will not log in and will be unusable
* Once done save and close the file
* Open commandline go to the folder where "fortKnight.py" is located then type and enter `python fortKnight.py`(python3 for Linux users) to run this bot
* Close the commandline to make the bot go offline
* For help on discord bot account and invitation refer [this](https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration/wiki/How-to-get-a-token-and-channel-ID-for-Discord)*
